# Contribution Guideline

 - Before adding any resource, make sure:
   - It's not already included in the list.
   - There isn't a [pull request](https://github.com/Stichoza/awesome-georgia/pulls) for the same resource.
 - Separate pull request for a single package/lib.
 - Check grammar.
 - Describe your pull request well.
 - No ads in descriptions.
 - Descriptions in English (Many foreigner developers use these packages).
 - **Only** add resources that other developers **can use** - i.e. packages, libs, language-packs, etc. **DO NOT** add just apps and other stuff.
